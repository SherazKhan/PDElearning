# PDElearning
Code repository for the paper "Learning partial differential equations for biological transport models from noisy spatiotemporal data". See https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04733

data_denoising/ - This folder contains the code that denoise data and approximate their partial derivatives with various methods.

PDEFIND/ - This folder contains the code to perform the PDE learning aspect of our study.

animations/ - This folder contains animations of the finite difference, bi-spline, and neural network surface fitting methods applied to the advection diffusion, Fisher-KPP, and nonlinear Fisher-KPP equations.
