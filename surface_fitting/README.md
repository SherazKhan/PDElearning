This folder contains the methods that denoise data and approximate their partial derivatives. The DEMO.py file allows the user to train a new surface fitting artificial neural network (ANN) or make predictions using the ANN, finite difference, spline, or bi-spline methods. All ANN parameters are stored in the checkpoints folder. All predictions are automatically stored in the data folder. The prediction_functions.py file contains the code to forward evaluate the ANN, finite difference, spline, and bi-spline methods. The custom_functions.py file contains functions used for training new ANN models. The surface_fitter.py file contains the SurfNN class which handles loading data, training new ANNs, and making predictions. This code can also save figures in the plots folder during training to illustrate ANN convergence.

To compare the different methods, make_rmse_tables.py computes relative mean square errors (RMSEs) between the true function/derivative values and the approximations. To make animations, make_animations.py saves a number of plots in the animations folder and combines them into a .gif file. The plots are deleted after the .gif file is complete.
